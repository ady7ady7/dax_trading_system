📊 STATISTICAL FEATURE VALIDATION REPORT
   DAX Trend-Following Trading System
==========================================================================================

🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
   Statistical validation identified 0 features
   out of 86 engineered features that meet
   rigorous statistical significance and effect size criteria.

   Selection Rate: 0.0%
   Processing Time: 19.52 seconds

📈 VALIDATION PIPELINE RESULTS:
   ├─ Total features tested: 86
   ├─ Passed initial screening: 41
   ├─ Had sufficient data: 41
   ├─ Significant before correction: 22
   ├─ Significant after correction: 41
   └─ Met all final criteria: 0

⚙️ VALIDATION PARAMETERS:
   Significance level (α): 0.005
   Minimum effect size: 0.3
   Multiple testing correction: fdr_bh
   Temporal consistency threshold: 60%

❌ NO FEATURES MEET ALL VALIDATION CRITERIA

   Possible reasons:
   • Features lack sufficient predictive power
   • Validation criteria are too stringent
   • Target variable definition needs refinement
   • More sophisticated feature engineering required

🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TRADING STRATEGY:
   ❌ INSUFFICIENT: Consider alternative approaches
   • Review feature engineering methodology
   • Explore different timeframes or market regimes
   • Consider regime-specific feature validation

🔬 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY:
   This validation framework implements multiple hypothesis tests:
   • Pearson correlation (linear relationships)
   • Spearman correlation (monotonic relationships)
   • Independent t-test (group differences)
   • Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric differences)
   • F-statistic from regression
   • Mutual information (non-linear relationships)

   Multiple testing correction (fdr_bh) controls
   false discovery rate to ensure statistical rigor.

   Walk-forward validation tests temporal stability across
   multiple time windows to ensure robustness.
