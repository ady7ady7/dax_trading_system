- We've introduced Statistical Validation with 6 tests and 10 sets of parameters (in Quant_Trading-Kids_BIble)

- In near future we have to achieve 2 things:
-- add PARAMETERS optimization (emas periods etc) and run the analysis with different parameters
-- Make SV go through all sets of parameters and return the most meaningful results
