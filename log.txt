WHOLE ETL + FILTERING process seems to work well now
+ The only thing we need to implement there is TV data download (+ scheduling the updates in a set interval)

BUT NOW WE CAN FOCUS ON FEATURE ENGINEERING and make sure it works


+ Some time later, I'd also like to include another type of filtering, based on number of trading days lookback. But I stick to what we have now, full dataset to begin with.
